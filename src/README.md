# Final Project - Analysis of Census Income Data

__Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook in this directory for the full analysis.__

## Abstract

Some sort of income is a necessity for people to survive in the US. This necessity should not be dictated by factors that are out of our control, yet income gaps continue to persist. The first step towards addressing income gaps is identifying the factors that are contributing to them. In doing so, we open up the opportunity for more research to hone in on the causes and what can be done to make changes.

This analysis sets forth to identify whether income gaps exist and specifically what relationships and insights can be found with respect to income. It covers a variety of societal factors that the US census believes contribute toward an individual's income level. In doing so, we build a logistic regression prediction model to classify individuals into one of two income groups given a set of features.

The findings are not all what we set out to investigate. During the analysis we discovered many limitations and data integrity issues that add a particular level of confounding to the results. We learned that part of the problem surrounding income gaps and using data science to identify the issues, is that the data available is not detailed enough to provide accurate insight or results.
